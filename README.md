1. Touchable opacity is a wrapper that reacts to touches by reducing the opacity of the children when touched/pressed

2. KeyboardAvoidingView - is a layout wrapper that moves or resizes its children when the keyboard appears, so inputs are not hidden.

Why it exists

On mobile, the keyboard can cover TextInput fields.
KeyboardAvoidingView automatically adjusts the layout to avoid that.
